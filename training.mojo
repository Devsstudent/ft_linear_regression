fn main():
	#Make the linear regression there
	#So i have to make the linear regression of my data, that will give me a line ax + b with a theta1 and b is theta0

	#That i will store in the file, to use it in the other program

	#So there is parsing of the data file + conversion

	#Then apply the regression (i dont really know how)

	#should be like making a first line and make the average of the 2 and etc etc
